# Adster - Ad Management

To use Adster simply download it into your plugins folder and activate it. You will see an
"Ads" tab on the admin side bar, click to add an Ad. You will see a shortcode, place this shortcode anywhere to yield the ad.

## Examples

- Example 1: \[adster_custom_ad id="1"\]Our NFL Pick: Vikings +3\[/adster_custom_ad\]
- Example 2: \[adster_custom_ad id="1" title="Our NFL Pick: Vikings +3"\]
- Example 3: \[adster_custom_ad id="1"\] (this will just display the title of the ad as title)
